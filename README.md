# zola-academic

[![Build and deploy GH Pages](https://github.com/zola-academic/zola-academic/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zola-academic/zola-academic/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A theme inspired by [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

[You can check the demo here](https://zola-academic.github.io).

*This is a work in progress, it can't hold a candle to hugo-academic*

It's based on [bulma](https://bulma.io/) and with the latest update, it has an automatic dark theme!

# Getting started

You should first [install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

Once that's done, I suggest that you start by cloning the example site, with the zola-academic theme as a submodule:

``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zola-academic/zola-academic-example
```

Then, you should be able to go in the `zola-academic-example` directory and run

```
zola serve
```

to see if everything is working and have some fun.
