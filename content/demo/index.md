## Descriptions

### Desktop versions

These versions are meant to be accessed through a computer. They use keyboard
and mouse controls:

  - W, A, S and D keys (or Z, Q, S, and D keys for azerty keyboards, or the
    arrow keys) translate the camera
  - The mouse allow to turn the camera just like in first person shooting games

---

#### [Desktop controls][1]

This is the default interface.

---

#### [Desktop controls with bookmarks][2]

This interface brings bookmarks to ease the navigation and thumbnails to be
able to preview what will happen when a bookmark will be clicked.

---

### Mobile versions

These versions are meant to be accessed through a mobile device (e.g., a
smartphone or a tablet).
They allow to move the camera by physically moving around the device (by using
the gyroscope).

---

#### [Free controls][3]

This version show a little joystick on the screen, that you can touch to move
the camera just like you would do on the desktop version with the keyboard. It
also features bookmarks.

This version is still in development and the touch actions don't seem to work
on Apple devices.

---

#### [Camera path][4]

In this version, you don't control the position of the camera. It is just like
you would be in a bus: you can move the device to look around but the path
followed by the camera is fixed.

It doesn't feature touch interaction, so it might be a compensation for those
who have apple devices.

---

#### [Google Cardboard][5]

This version is the same as the camera path one, except it renders the scene
twice, and displays the two renders of the left and right part of the screen.
You can touch the screen to put the application into fullscreen mode (to hide
the top bar of your browser) and place the smartphone in a Google
Cardboard-like thing.

A few bugs are expected in the version, the main problem being the fact that
the smartphone automatically fades the screen out and locks itself after a
certain period without interaction, so you might end in the dark, I'm sorry :cry:
